      <h2>Don't Worry About "Failed" Movie Requests</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, it's Aidan & George!
      </p>
      <p>
        Hi again, just another quick follow up! Had a slight issue with the requests website this morning, and you may have gotten
        an "Access Denied" message if you tried to log in. That should be resolved now, and you are free to go absolutely
        wild and request as much as you want!
      </p>
      <p>
        As previously mentioned, the automatic approval of movie requests has been temporarily suspended, and so if you
        request a movie, you will see that your request says "Failed". Don't worry about that, just ignore it and make
        as many requests as you want! We can still see the requests, and we will still approve them manually.
      </p>
